  <p>I knew a doctor who often had to deal with dying people, and one time he told me something I always remembered. He said that sometimes the reason family members demand extraordinary measures, like tubes and respirators to keep a sick person alive when there&rsquo;s no hope, is because they feel like they didn't do enough for the person earlier in life. He said it was probably because they felt a little guilt, so they wanted to do more at the last minute. It seemed a little strange to me, but now I understand it better.</p>
  <p> After Ricardo died, Alej and I went to Santa Fe, New Mexico for a memorial milonga for him. It was very nice. Everyone danced, and then we watched some videos. But as we watched the videos, I suddenly started to feel bad. And afterwards, I couldn&rsquo;t dance. I just wanted to be by myself. When I saw him on the screen it suddenly came to me that I had hurt him&hellip; and that there was nothing I could do about it. All Ricardo ever really wanted was to be liked, and respected&hellip; and I&rsquo;m ashamed to admit, there was a time when I did neither. And even worse, I suddenly felt like he knew it.</p>
  <p> I think what happened was that somewhere along the line, I got a little tired of Ricardo. I stopped really listening to him, and I moved on to other friends. But it was even worse than that. I was discovering all sorts of new dancers, and filming them, and Ricardo&rsquo;s dancing, which I had seen a hundred times, just didn&rsquo;t seem as interesting. It was a time when I forgot how brilliant he really was&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t keep my big mouth shut about it, either. I remember one evening in a <em>parrilla</em> on <em>Corrientes</em> with Osvaldo Natucci, and his old partner Eladia Cordoba (I think Osvaldo Buglione, his partner in their <em>El Beso</em> milonga was also there). Natu and I were drinking wine and having a great time, and I kept going on about Tete. Well, of course Natu knew Tete very well&hellip; in fact he lived with him in a large house along with Gerard Gelli, and several other milongueros. And he also knew Ricardo very well. Natu&rsquo;s ex-wife Muma, who is a famous milonguera, was one of Ricardo&rsquo;s teaching partners. (It was because Muma was sick and couldn&rsquo;t teach with Ricardo that I first met Alejandra in the club on <em>Suipacha</em>. Alej had come at the last minute to help Ricardo with the class. A very small tango world, Buenos Aires.)</p>
  <p>So Natu and I were getting pretty loud, and kidding around:    </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Me: &ldquo;Tete is great&hellip;&rdquo; <br />
      Eladia: &ldquo;Yeah, Tete is great.&rdquo;<br />
      Natu: &quot;You have to understand, Ricardo Vidort is a maestro.&rdquo; <br />
      Me: &quot;But Tete can do things no one else can.&rdquo; <br />
      Natu: &quot;You need to study Ricardo more. He&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Grand Architect&rsquo; of tango.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Alej knew more than anyone else at the table because she had danced with both Ricardo and Tete a hundred times, and she knew just how good Ricardo was&mdash;but she was smart enough to keep quiet. We went round and round, and finally when things settled down, Natu said, &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t really say. Tango is art. Who can say what&rsquo;s better?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Of course, your right&hellip;(pause)&hellip; but&hellip;(pause)... I still think... <em>Tete is better than</em> ...&rdquo; Before I could finish, Natu and everyone else at the table joined in and finished the sentence for me, and we were all laughing loudly. I think half the people in the place heard it.</p>
  <p> Since he died several people have told me that Ricardo said I was a great dancer&hellip; but he never said it to me. He was always correcting me, which I now realize was a huge and valuable favor. He, like several of the other milongueros, cared enough to break the codes and give me instruction right in the milongas. But as I got better in tango, I got the stupid idea that he was trying to show everyone that I was his student. One night he came up as Alej and I were walking onto the floor, took my arm, and said, &ldquo;Shoot the feet! Shoot the feet!&rdquo; (He was always saying this, and it took me a long time to really understand what he meant.) It&rsquo;s very important advice, but I was feeling a little annoyed with him. It happened right in front of several milongueros, just as Alej and I were ready to dance... so I made a pistol with my finger, and pretended to take a couple of shots at my feet. Everyone around saw it, and laughed, (even Ricardo). But now, I can see that he really just wanted to help, and it was a disrespectful thing for me to do&mdash;especially in front of other milongueros.</p>
